# About Me

## ðŸŽ® Game Development

- **Unity & C#:** Leveraging Unity and C# to create engaging 3D games with smooth mechanics and interactive features.
- **Multiplayer Games:** Developing multiplayer game systems that enable seamless online play and engaging social interactions.
- **Dialogue Systems:** Designing and implementing dialogue management systems that support complex, player-driven interactions.

- **App Optimization:** Ensuring smooth performance and efficiency through optimized code and thoughtful design practices.

## ðŸš€ Current Projects

Iâ€™m currently working on a [Bargaining and Conversation System](https://github.com/sumansingha47/Dialogue-System-3D), a 3D dialogue system developed in Unity. This project showcases a unique bargaining mechanic between a Steam shopkeeper and a gamer, aimed at creating a dynamic and engaging interaction for players on Microsoft Windows (PC).

## ðŸŒ± Always Learning

As a mid-level developer, Iâ€™m always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. I enjoy exploring new technologies, improving my craft, and staying updated on industry trends to stay ahead of the curve.
